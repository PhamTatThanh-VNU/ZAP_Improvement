**The OWASP ® Foundation** works to improve the security of software through its community-led open source software projects, hundreds of chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and by hosting local and global conferences. 
## Spotlight: Corgea

Corgea helps engineers ship code and not vulnerabilities. It's an AI-powered SAST, unlike traditional SAST with tons of false positives, Corgea can find vulnerabilities like business logic flaws, API vulnerabilities, and broken authentication with little false positives (<5%). It also writes security fixes for engineers to approve.
